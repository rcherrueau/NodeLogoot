All the algorithms have been run 10 times with same data and the same conditions. Figures \ref{fig:users_operations_2g_report} and \ref{fig:users_operations_1t_big} p.\pageref{fig:users_operations_2g_report} shows the total number of users operations.\\

The increases are due to insert or delete a large group of characters on the document. All the algorithms decrease over the time because of the size of the document (the unique identifier gets bigger when there are a lot of operations) but logoot decreases slowly compared to the others.\\

Wooto, Logoot and RGA remain stable during all the time. The behavior of SOCT2 performance is mainly due to its garbage collection mechanism. Users have a period of inactivity and the garbage mechanism cannot purge the history log. SOCT2 can't be used for real-time editing because of his response time increasing 50ms quickly.\\

Figure \ref{fig:characters_operations_1t_big} is a bit different than \ref{fig:characters_operations_2g_report} because of the number of characters deleting (students didn't delete as much as in the serie experiments as in the report experiment). RGA and WootH are better than the others because their algorithms are based on hash tables.\\
