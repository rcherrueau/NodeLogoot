All the algorithms have been runned 10 times with same data and the same conditions. Figures \ref{fig:users_operations_2g_report} and \ref{fig:users_operations_1t_big} p.\pageref{fig:users_operations_2g_report} shows the total number of users operations.

The increases are due to insert or delete a large group of characters on the document. All the algorithms decrease over the time because of the size of the document (the unique identifier is bigger when there is a lot of operations) but logoot decrease slowly than the others.\\

Figures \ref{fig:characters_operations_2g_report} and \ref{fig:characters_operations_1t_big} p.\pageref{fig:characters_operations_2g_report} shows the total number of characters operations.

Wooto, Logoot and RGA remains stable during al the time. The behavior of SOCT2 performance is mainly due to its garbage collection mechanism. Users had a period of inactivity and the garbage mechanism cannot purge the history log. SOCT2 can't be used for real-time editing because of his response time increasing 50ms quickly.\\

Figure \ref{fig:characters_operations_2g_report} is a bite different than \ref{fig:characters_operations_1t_big} because of the number of characters deletes (students didn't delete much less in the series experiments as in the report experiment). RGA and WootH are better than the other because there algorithms are based on hash tables.\\
