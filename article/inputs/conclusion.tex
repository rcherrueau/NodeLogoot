In conclusion, this is a first the first performance evaluation of algorithms with real collaboration traces including concurrency. This experimentation demonstrate the suitability of CRDT algorithms in real-time collaboration and they outperform some representative opera- tional transformation approaches that were well established for real-time collaboration in terms of local generation time and remote integration time.
