CRDT have some caracteristic:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The concurrent operations are natively commutative.
	\item The document is a linear sequence of elements.
	\item A unic position identifier.
\end{itemize}~

For the experiments, they select differents algorithms for generating the unic position identifier:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Logoot
	\item RGA
	\item WOOT
	\item WOOTO
	\item WOOTH
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:worst} p.\pageref{fig:worst} (with R the number of replicas and by H the number of operations on the document) shows the theoretical evaluation of this differents algorithms. RGA and Logoot have the bests results.

But this is just theoretical. The equip of the paper designed real-time peer-to-peer collaborations in order to obtain there logs and apply them on the algorithms. For real applications, two experiments and severals groups have been mades:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 3 grups have to do there semester report only using the collaborating editor during one and a half hours:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 2 grups of 4 students.
			\item 1 grup of 5 students.
		\end{itemize}
	\item 9 grups of 2 students have to translate an episode of \emph{The Big Bang Theory}
\end{itemize}~

Figure \ref{fig:operations} p.\pageref{fig:operations} shows the total number of users/character operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A user operation is adding/deleting letters or grups (copy/past).
	\item A character operaton is the transformation of each user operation into a character operation (for example, copy/past "alma" are the character operations: \begin{itemize}
					\item adding 'a' at space 0
					\item adding 'l' at space 1
					\item ...
				\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}~

\end{figure}

All the algorithms have been runned 10 times with same datas and sames conditions. Figures \ref{fig:users_operations_1t_big} and \ref{fig:users_operations_2g_report} p.\pageref{fig:users_operations_2g_report} shows the total number of users operations.

The increases are due to insert or delete a large group of characters on the document. All the algorithms decrease over the time because of the size of the document (the unique identifier is bigger when there is a lot of operations) but logoot decrease slowly than the others.\\
