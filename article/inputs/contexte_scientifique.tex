CRDT has some features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The concurrent operations are natively commutative.
	\item The document is a linear sequence of elements.
	\item A single position identifier.
\end{itemize}~

Regarding to experiments, they select differents algorithms to generate the single position identifier:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Logoot
	\item RGA
	\item WOOT
	\item WOOTO
	\item WOOTH
\end{itemize}

The figure \ref{fig:worst} p.\pageref{fig:worst} (with R the number of replicas and by H the number of operations on the document) shows the theoretical evaluation of these differents algorithms. Thus we see that RGA and Logoot have the bests results.
